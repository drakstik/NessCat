Medium,10.204.224.10,SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted,"The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can
occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

Medium,10.204.224.17,SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE),"The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","
Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC

Medium,10.204.224.19,Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Protocol Server Man-in-the-Middle Weakness,"The remote version of the Remote Desktop Protocol Server (Terminal
Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

High,10.204.224.19,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

Medium,10.204.224.19,SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE),"The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","
Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

It appears that TLSv1 or newer is supported on the server. However, the 
Fallback SCSV mechanism is not supported, allowing connections to be ""rolled 
back"" to SSLv3.

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client

allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted,

private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

High,10.204.224.22,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.
Use TLS 1.2 (with approved cipher suites) or higher instead.","

Medium,10.204.224.22,SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE),"The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","
Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

It appears that TLSv1 or newer is supported on the server. However, the 
Fallback SCSV mechanism is not supported, allowing connections to be ""rolled 
back"" to SSLv3.

Medium,10.204.224.23,SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted,"The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can
occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

Medium,10.204.224.24,Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Protocol Server Man-in-the-Middle Weakness,"The remote version of the Remote Desktop Protocol Server (Terminal
Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

High,10.204.224.24,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

Medium,10.204.224.24,SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE),"The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","
Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

It appears that TLSv1 or newer is supported on the server. However, the 
Fallback SCSV mechanism is not supported, allowing connections to be ""rolled

Medium,10.204.224.25,SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted,"The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can
occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong

    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the

Medium,10.204.224.3,SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE),"The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","
Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC

implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade

these protocols be disabled entirely.

Medium,10.204.224.4,SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE),"The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","
Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

It appears that TLSv1 or newer is supported on the server. However, the 
Fallback SCSV mechanism is not supported, allowing connections to be ""rolled 
back"" to SSLv3.

client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the

Medium,10.204.224.5,SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE),"The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Medium,10.204.224.6,SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted,"The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can
occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

Medium,10.204.224.6,SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE),"The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","
Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC 
cipher suite, indicating that this server is vulnerable.

client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

Medium,10.204.224.7,SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted,"The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can
occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

Medium,10.204.224.7,SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE),"The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","
Nessus determined that the remote server supports SSLv3 with at least one CBC

client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

Medium,10.204.224.8,SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE),"The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Medium,10.204.224.8,TLS Version 1.0 Protocol Detection,"The remote service accepts connections encrypted using TLS 1.0. TLS 1.0 has a
number of cryptographic design flaws. Modern implementations of TLS 1.0
mitigate these problems, but newer versions of TLS like 1.2 and 1.3 are
designed against these flaws and should be used whenever possible.

As of March 31, 2020, Endpoints that arenâ€™t enabled for TLS 1.2
and higher will no longer function properly with major web browsers and major vendors.

PCI DSS v3.2 requires that TLS 1.0 be disabled entirely by June 30,
