occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

methods are allowed on each directory.

The following HTTP methods are considered insecure:
  PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, TRACE, HEAD

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough
tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes'
in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and
considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400,
403, 405, or 501.

authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials
for the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"SMB was detected on port 445 but no credentials were provided.

20007,,7.1,High,10.204.224.17,tcp,6200,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known
weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the

    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.",#NAME?,,"Port 1063 was detected as being open but is now closed

allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted,

20007,,7.1,High,10.204.224.19,tcp,1063,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known
weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

need to be done again.",#NAME?,,"Port 2000 was detected as being open but is now closed

  - The remote server is affected by a denial of service
    vulnerability if configured to use the Java AJP
    connector. An attacker can send a malicious request with
    invalid headers which causes the AJP connector to be put

    along with the 'MemoryRealm', 'DataSourceRealm', or
    'JDBCRealm' authentication realms. (CVE-2009-0580)

  - The remote server is affected by a script injection
    vulnerability if the example JSP application,

Tomcat 5.5.x listening on the remote host is prior to 5.5.34. It is,
there, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :

  - Several weaknesses were found in the HTTP Digest
    authentication implementation. The issues are as
    follows: replay attacks are possible, server nonces
    are not checked, client nonce counts are not checked,
    'quality of protection' (qop) values are not checked,
    realm values are not checked and the server secret is
    a hard-coded, known string. The effect of these issues
    is that Digest authentication is no stronger than Basic
    authentication. (CVE-2011-1184, CVE-2011-5062,
    CVE-2011-5063, CVE-2011-5064)

  - An error handling issue exists related to the
    MemoryUserDatabase that allows user passwords to be
    disclosed through log files. (CVE-2011-2204)

  - An input validation error exists that allows a local
    attacker to either bypass security or carry out denial
    of service attacks when the APR or NIO connectors are
    enabled. (CVE-2011-2526)

  - A component that Apache Tomcat relies on called 'jsvc'
    contains an error in that it does not drop capabilities
    after starting and can allow access to sensitive files
    owned by the super user. Note this vulnerability only
    affects Linux operating systems and only when 'jsvc' is
    compiled with libpcap and the '-user' parameter is
    used. (CVE-2011-2729)

  - Specially crafted requests are incorrectly processed by
    Tomcat and can cause the server to allow injection of
    arbitrary AJP messages. This can lead to authentication
    bypass and disclosure of sensitive information. Note
    this vulnerability only occurs when the
    org.apache.jk.server.JkCoyoteHandler AJP connector is

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"SMB was detected on port 445 but no credentials were provided.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

need to be done again.",#NAME?,,"Port 1433 was detected as being open but is now closed

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP

traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client

allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.
Use TLS 1.2 (with approved cipher suites) or higher instead.","https://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-ssl.pdf

The following HTTP methods are considered insecure:
  PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, TRACE, HEAD

Many frameworks and languages treat 'HEAD' as a 'GET' request, albeit
one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

As this list may be incomplete, the plugin also tests - if 'Thorough
tests' are enabled or 'Enable web applications tests' is set to 'yes'
in the scan policy - various known HTTP methods on each directory and
considers them as unsupported if it receives a response code of 400,
403, 405, or 501.

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when

traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted,

private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

20007,,7.1,High,10.204.224.24,tcp,49177,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known
weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be

    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

authentication level negotiation over Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

communications between a client and a server hosting a SAM database

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer

able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service

authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials
for the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for
error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.",n/a,,"SMB was detected on port 445 but no credentials were provided.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

need to be done again.",#NAME?,,"Port 7070 was detected as being open but is now closed

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.",Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.,"https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

51192,,6.4,Medium,10.204.224.26,tcp,7070,SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted,The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.,"The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can
occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.",Purchase or generate a proper SSL certificate for this service.,"https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to

unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

need to be done again.",#NAME?,,"Port 1025 was detected as being open but is now unresponsive

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer

disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when

traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client

allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted,

private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

20007,,7.1,High,10.204.224.6,tcp,443,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known
weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV
mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.","https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

20007,,7.1,High,10.204.224.7,tcp,1025,SSL Version 2 and 3 Protocol Detection,"The remote service encrypts traffic using a protocol with known
weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be

one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the

    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.
